# ‚óç Espionage for InfiltrationEngine
An AIO plugin created for InfiltrationEngine for heist-planners and builders alike.

Espionage is useful for custom mission creators that need a singular plugin in order to speed up mission development. Espionage solves the problem of plugin cluttering by combining the multiple plugins into a singular window modal that can be resized to the user's liking. This plugin is not required in any way, and it is highly recommended that you practice with the original plugin before continuing with this AIO tool.

Place the plugin within the plugin folder, and press the Initalize button. If you haven't set up your Workspace & ReplicatedStorage, press the Setup button, and it will prepare both Workspace and ReplicatedStorage with the neccessary items. **You will have to restart studio to reinitalize the plugin.**
