# ◍ Espionage for InfiltrationEngine
An AIO plugin created for InfiltrationEngine for heist-planners and builders alike.

Espionage is useful for custom mission creators that need a singular plugin in order to speed up mission development. Espionage solves the problem of plugin cluttering by combining the multiple plugins into a singular window modal that can be resized to the user's liking. This plugin is not required in any way, and it is highly recommended that you practice with the original plugin before continuing with this AIO tool.

Place the plugin within the plugin folder, and press the Initalize button. If you haven't set up your Workspace & ReplicatedStorage, press the Setup button, and it will prepare both Workspace and ReplicatedStorage with the neccessary items. **You will have to restart studio to reinitalize the plugin.**

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> **This repository is a fork of the original.** It's recommended that you refer to the original repo for more information, https://github.com/MoonstoneSkies/InfiltrationEngine-Custom-Missions

Espionage was originally developed to supply developers using Infiltration Engine to create custom misions inside Entry Point : Freelancers Cut with a all-in-one implementation to speed up workflow and organize the clutter that plugin buttons create, by compiling it into a singular, useful, and de-cluttered plugin modal. Since then, multiple features will soon be implemented onto the incoming updates.

* Clean roblox-styled UI, simple and efficent in terms of workflow
* A modified mission exporter, courtesy of @Sprixitite, provides extra tooling for more advanced users
* The Cell Marker, pulled from the original plugins
* The Meadow Map, pulled from the original plugins
* The Door Access plugin, pulled from the original repository
* A modified version of Prop Preview, called Visualization, allowing you to see the different attributes in real-time, soon to include Network Link visualization.
* The Prop Barrier plugin, pulled from the original repository.
* The Combat Flow Map plugin, pulled from the original repository.
* The Section Visibility plugin, pulled from the original repository.

There are also some upcoming features that are unique to this plugin,
* Filter Check, which can automatically check if the following custom string will be filtered
* StateComponent Visual Editor, which can visualize state components, and can allow you to edit their properties in real-time
* Optimization Check, which can tell you directly whats increasing the amount of codes, which can reduce mission loading times.
* Dialogue Cutscenes, which can create dialogue cutscenes using BlackoutScreen and LocalChat in combination with eachother.
* NPC Dynamic Route creator, which is similar to Meadow Map, and can create multiple different links, creating more pathfinding routes.
