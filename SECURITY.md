# Security & Reporting Bugs

## General Security with Bugs

For any and all bugs with the plugin, report it to @whindx_ on discord. State the specific problem, outcome, and how I can replicate it. Bugs from the user's own fault should not be reported.

Do not report any individual plugin bugs towards Cishshato or with anyone associated with Freefall Softworks at all. 

> [!TIP]
> Any fork of a repository shouldn't have bugs or problems reported to the original repository.

Bugs that are specifically related to the client or engine itself in-game should be reported to Cish. This plugin has not been heavily tested and you may encounter bugs in some specific situations.[^1]

## Security Vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities that go against Roblox's TOS should be reported to @whindx_ on discord. State the specific problem, outcome, and how I can replicate it.

[^1]: Not ALL bugs can be fixed. Certain bugs that are due to Roblox's engine limitations are not my fault, and may result in the bugs to become unfixable. However, certain unfixable bugs may be reworked in a later version if the code gets a major rewrite.
